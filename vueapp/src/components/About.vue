      <h3 id='about'>Our Story</h3>
      CoZ was born out of an intense passion to create something of musical significance and of eternal value. “If we could only ever produce one album, what would we want to leave behind as our footprint on this world? More than just a catchy riff or a memorable lyric, we want to leave behind Truth, Love and Hope. And if we could only ever produce one album, we humbly realized that we were going to attempt to put the most life altering, history changing and artistically beautiful subject matter chronologically to music...the Bible.”
      <br><br>
      What came next can only be described as an inspired and emotional writing frenzy. Chris’ father had just tragically passed away and he therapeutically immersed himself completing the bulk of the original music and lyrics in a few short months.
      <br><br>
      Quickly realizing the impossible magnitude of attempting Scripture in its entirety, the album, now called Foreshadowing Light, started to take shape as a unique music production which weaves scripture and biblical events together through a dramatic story-line. This allowed us to coherently narrow in on biblical events with a specific focus and purpose.
      <br><br>
      As artists we were deeply humbled and inspired at attempting to bring scriptural events to life through song and it is our earnest prayer that God would receive all glory as we strive to spread His message of life and redemption with the world He so loves.
      <br><br>
      Thank you so much for all of your love and prayers! Through your support we will be able to take the next steps of professionally recording the album and take the production wherever God opens doors.
